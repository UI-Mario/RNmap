                    I'm a Software Engineer, currently working as Web Developer at <a class="inline" href="https://chialab.it">Chialab</a>, a communication and design company based in Bologna.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated at 25 in Software Engineering, in Bologna. My graduation thesis was about IoT in Sports, and featured the implementation
                    of a complete IoT platform, moving data from sensors to a Web dashboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 4+ of experience working with Web technologies, I discovered my passion about innovative communication solutions such as Augmented Reality.
                    So, I started to dig into AR.js, the most popular Web AR project in Open Source. With time, I became the maintainer of the project and now I continue to keep it alive and to build a community around it.
                    I'm now leading the project, periodically adding features to it and managing issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also the author of GeoAR.js, the first Location-Based Web AR library, written in Javascript and thought for the Web.
                    I'm an AR teacher and researcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also an expert about Web Accessibility. I periodically write on Medium, a blog platform, about Augmented Reality, Agile development and Accessibility.
                    Sometimes, I take part to tech conferences as speaker.
                    I had also experience as teacher about Agile Software Development in post-graduate schools, in Bologna.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My aim is to make possible for everyone, students, artists, teachers, developers, to build useful experiences with Augmented Reality, for free, using Open Source software.
                    Augmented Reality can be used for learning, to treat particular kinds of phobias, to find new ways of interacting with the world, and to communicate.
                    It can be used to provide informations that we usually don't have, and to provide help to those who need it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I see too much potential on this technology wasted with funny and unuseful projects. There's nothing bad in having fun with it.
                    What's not right, in my opinion, is to concentrate on technology only and not enough on its possible, useful use cases.
                    Next years I will focus, among the other things, on this mission.
                </p>
